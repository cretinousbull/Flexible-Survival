Urik is a man.
The description of Urik is "[UrikDesc]";

to say UrikDesc:
	say "     Urik looks the part of a proud orc warrior, tall and strong, with a brutishly handsome face, its square jaw showing two sharp tusks jutting upwards. The only shred of cloth on his impressive physique is a rather flimsy loincloth, its thin fabric leaving little to the imagination... proving that the saying about big hands and feet is quite accurate for some. Only his hair does deviate a little from the typical image of an orc, by being longer than the usual short crop - its shiny length gathered into a ponytail that hangs down his back.";
	say "     In his behaviour though, the orc couldn't be more out of character with the norm. After publicly mistreating one of the human-sized breeder orcs he owned, Boghrim forced him into becoming a breeder slut himself, making him hunger for hard dicks and a tasty load of cum in his belly...";
	
The conversation of Urik is { "<Placeholder>" }.

The scent of Urik is "     Urik has a quite masculine smell, underlined with a little bit of sweat and cum that somehow just makes him more attractive.".
